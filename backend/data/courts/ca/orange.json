Their photos are on the outside of court #2, and their schedules are on the door. They can also have private lessons in those courts whenever they needed. The four courts are only open when no teaching pro is teaching. Please don't challenge the teaching pro for an open court (such as Court 2 or Court A/B) even it is not used at that moment. Teaching pro can have a class up to 8 students, and those students pay for using court #1 & 2. Not just court #1. \n\nReservations are possible for courts 5 & 6. Check the city website for reserving a court at www.yourirvine.org. A group is limited to a single reservation per day. \n\nThe courts have adapted an open play by convention, where a player can place a paddle at the side of the net post and claim the next game on that court. That convention may not coincide with the posted rules for the courts by the city of Irvine, but is widely used by consensus during the day.\n\nGroups occupying any of the courts for more than two hours must vacate the courts for those in waiting. Players are friendly and courteous and expect you to be the same.
